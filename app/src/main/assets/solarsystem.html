<h1>The Solar System</h1>

<p>The Solar System is made up of all the planets that orbit our Sun. In addition to planets, the Solar System also consists of moons, comets, asteroids, minor planets, dust and gas. The inner solar system contains the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. The main asteroid belt lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The planets of the outer solar system are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune (Pluto is now classified as a dwarf planet).</p>

<p>
    Everything in the Solar System orbits or revolves around the Sun. The Sun contains around 98% of all the material in the Solar System. The larger an object is, the more gravity it has. Because the Sun is so large, its powerful gravity attracts all the other objects in the Solar System towards it. At the same time, these objects, which are moving very rapidly, try to fly away from the Sun, outward into the emptiness of outer space.
</p>
<p>
    The result of the planets trying to fly away, at the same time that the Sun is trying to pull them inward is that they become trapped half-way in between. Balanced between flying towards the Sun and escaping into space, they spend eternity orbiting around their parent star.
</p>
<p>
    The Planets orbit in the same direction (counter-clockwise looking down from above the Sunâ€™s North Pole); all but Venus, Uranus and Pluto also rotate in that same sense. Mercury has the fastest elliptical orbit,48 km per second. It has the shortest revolution at 88 days. Pluto has an orbital speed of 5 km per second. It takes 248 years for Pluto to make one complete revolution.</p>
