<h1>THE SUN</h1>

<p>
    The sun is the largest star in the solar system but the smallest star in the universe. It is found at the center and the planets revolve around the sun. It has a spherical shape. The Sun is very far away from the earth and it is not possible to land on the sun due to its very high temperatures. Scientists have said the sun is about four and a half billion years old. It glows due to the hot gas contained within it,these are hydrogen and helium. It is four hundred thousand times brighter than the full moon. This is the reason as to why it is easy to look at the moon with our naked eyes but it is difficult to look directly at the sun..</p>
<p>
    The sun provides solar energy that can provide electricity through solar cells. The sun’s energy is also used to grow crops. It also warms up the earth. Without the sun, the earth could be a cold planet that would not have been able to support life. The sun’s energy aids the water cycle by evaporating the rain and surface water to form clouds which then form rain. Even in our day-to-day life, we use sunlight to dry clothes.

<p style ="color:#fff1d1;">The sun is the most important feature of the solar system. The sun leads to survival of life to exist on earth due to its numerous benefits. We hope to grow in our scientific technology to overcome it’s various negative effects like climate changes and damaging of the ozone, and harmful effects on humans (sunburn, eye damage, and damaging of the skin: skin cancer and premature aging).</p>
